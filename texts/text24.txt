A delicious apple pie!
An apple pie is a simple but very tasty meal1. It is very easy to make. It’s made of two parts: a crust and a filling. An apple pie can be single-crusted (with only one piece of crust on top or bottom), or double-crusted (with crust on top and on bottom).

The top of an apple pie can be solid, or the stripes2 of crust can form a lattice3 top. If you have a pie with a lattice top, you can see the filling even before you cut the pie!

The filling is made with apples. Some people prefer finely4 chopped apples, some add large slices5 instead. With large slices you will get a hearty6 pie, while the fine chop will make your pie very delicate.

An apple pie is a signature dish7 of many nations. The first written recipe is found in the 14th century book The Forme of Cury (The Method of Cooking in Middle English). That recipe also called for some pears, raisins and saffron.

An apple pie is also a signature American dish. Some people even call it an unofficial symbol of the United States.

The most basic (but still tasty!) apple pie needs 2 or 3 cups of flour, 2 eggs (1 beaten8 egg), a stick of butter, some salt and a cup of water for a crust. For a filling you can take 1 kg of apples, a cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons9 of flour. Make a simple pastry dough10 and let it rest in your fridge. Combine everything you need for a filling and refrigerate it as well. Place your dough into a pie dish, add filling and the top layer of crust. Make sure to pinch11 your crust so it’s sealed all around the pie. Brush12 your pie with the beaten egg and bake in a preheated oven at 200 °C for about an hour until the crust is golden brown. The pie can be served with an ice cream or a cheese topping. Bon appetit!
