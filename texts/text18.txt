Do you like watching cartoons? Probably you do! But how did they come to be? Who invented1 them?

This is actually a very tough question. The first cartoons were created long before the TV. For example, shadow play2 was a very popular form of entertainment3 in ancient China. Such shows looked almost like modern cartoons!

A toy called a flip book4 was made in the late 19th century. It was a small soft book with pictures. Each picture was drawn in a slightly different5 way. When you bend this book and release the pages one by one, the images start to move. Strictly speaking, they don’t, but our eyes see it like that anyway. The first real cartoons were made using this trick, too!

In 1895 brothers Louis and Auguste Lumiere created a cinematograph. It was a camera and a film projector in one device. Using this device, many aspiring6 film directors started to create their own cartoons.

This developed into a full industry by 1910. Many cartoons of that era are forgotten7 now, but some are still with us. For example, Felix the Cat was created by Otto Messmer in 1919, and he’s still with us, more than a hundred years later. Currently the rights8 to the character are held by DreamWorks Animation.

One of the pioneers9 in the industry was famous Walt Disney. He was not afraid to experiment to make a cartoon, and his Snow White film was among the firsts to use a multiplane camera. With its help the characters were able to move around the objects, creating an illusion of a 3D world.

Today most of the cartoons are made with computer animation. The last traditional Disney cartoon to date was Winnie the Pooh (2011).
