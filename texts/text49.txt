The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in New Zealand was reported on 28 February 2020. As of 15 December 2020, the country has had a total of 2,096 cases (1,740 confirmed and 356 probable[a]), of which 61 are currently active, and 25 people have died from the virus, with cases recorded in all twenty district health board (DHB) areas.[1] The pandemic peaked in early April, with 89 new cases recorded per day and 929 active cases.

All borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of managed isolation.

A four-level alert level system was introduced on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. The Alert Level was initially set at Level 2, but was subsequently raised to Level 3 on the afternoon of 23 March. Beginning on 25 March, the Alert Level was moved to Level 4, putting the country into a nationwide lockdown. The Alert Level was moved back down to Level 3 on 27 April, partially lifting some lockdown restrictions, and down to Level 2 on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing and gathering size limits. The country moved down to Level 1 on 8 June, removing all remaining restrictions except border controls.

On 11 August, four cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source were reported in Auckland, the first from an unknown source in 102 days. At noon the following day, the Auckland Region moved up to alert level 3, while the rest of the country was moved to level 2.[2][3][4] On 30 August at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to "Alert Level 2.5", a modified version of Alert Level 2 with limitation on public gatherings, funerals, and weddings.[5][6][7] On 23 September at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to Alert Level 2, after the rest of New Zealand moved to Alert Level 1 on 21 September at 11:59pm.[8][9] On 7 October, Auckland also moved down to level 1.[10]

New Zealand's approach to the pandemic has been widely praised internationally for its quick and tough action over the virus, having completed 1,030,115 tests as of 18 October 2020.

Background
Main article: COVID-19 pandemic
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was the cause of a respiratory illness (coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19), found in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples Republic of China, which had been reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[11][12]

The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[13][14] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll worldwide.[15][13]

"# of cases" includes both confirmed and probable cases.
Starting from 10 December, the Ministry of Health provides updates on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Previously, updates were provided daily.[25]
On 28 February 2020, New Zealand confirmed its first case, a woman in her 60s who had recently visited Iran and returned to Auckland on 26 February.[26][27]

New Zealand confirmed its second case on 4 March, a woman in her 30s who had recently returned from northern Italy.[28] The number of cases continued to rise significantly through March 2020, reaching a total of 647 (600 confirmed and 47 probable) and 74 recoveries by 31 March.[29]

On 29 March, New Zealand also reported its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s from the West Coast region.[30][31]

On 1 April 61 new cases were reported (47 confirmed and 14 probable), bringing the total to 708 (647 confirmed and 61 probable).[32] On 5 April, ethnicity statistics were released; indicating that 74% of those who had contracted COVID-19 were Pākehā, 8.3% Asian, 7.6% Māori, and 3.3% Pasifika.[33] By 30 April, the total number of cases had reached 1,476 (1,129 confirmed and 347 probable) while the total number of recoveries had risen to 1,241 and the death toll to 19.[34]

On 1 May, there were a total of 1,479 cases (1,132 confirmed and 347 probable) and 1,252 recoveries reported.[35] By 31 May, there were no new cases, keeping the total number at 1,504 (1,154 confirmed and 350 probable). The number of recovered had risen to 1,481 while the death toll reached 22. The last hospitalised person was also discharged on 27 May with only one active case remaining in the country by the end of the month.[36]

On 8 June, the last active case was declared as recovered.[37] By 19 June, Director-General Ashley Bloomfield confirmed that a total of 327,460 tests had been conducted in New Zealand with 6,273 tested the previous day.[38] After 24 consecutive days of no new cases, two new imported cases from the United Kingdom were reported on 16 June.[39] By 30 June, there were a total of 22 active cases (all resulting from overseas travel) in New Zealand, bringing the total number to 1,528 cases (1,178 confirmed and 350 probable). The number of recovered also rose to 1,484 while the death toll has remained at 22.[40]

By 31 July, there were 20 active cases (all resulting from overseas travel) in New Zealand, bringing the total number to 1,560 cases (1,210 confirmed and 350 probable). The total number of recovered had risen to 1,518 while the death toll has remained at 22.[41]

Following 102 days of no community transmissions, four such cases were reported in Auckland on 11 August, putting the city back into lockdown.[42] According to 1 News, Pacific Islanders made up 75% of the cases in the August community outbreak in Auckland.[43] By 31 August, there were 131 active cases in New Zealand, bringing the total number to 1,738 (1,387 confirmed and 351 probable). The total number of recovered had reached 1,585 while the death toll remained at 22.[44] The resurgence of coronavirus also prompted Ardern to delay the 2020 New Zealand general election from 19 September to 17 October.

On 4 September, after 98 days with no deaths, the country's 23rd death from COVID-19 was reported in Auckland.[45] The following day, the death of former Cook Islands prime minister Joe Williams, who was admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in August, was announced.[46] By 30 September, there were a total of 44 cases in New Zealand, bringing the total number to 1,836 (1,480 confirmed and 356 probable).

The Ministry of Health set up the National Health Coordination Centre (NHCC) on 28 January in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.[54] On 30 January, an "Infectious and Notifiable Diseases" came into effect, which required health practitioners to report any suspected cases under the Health Act 1956.[55][56]

February 2020
On 3 February, the New Zealand Government barred entry to foreign travellers who have left China, permitting only New Zealand citizens, permanent residents and family entry into the country.[57] Universities asked for the Government to exempt Chinese students travelling to study in New Zealand.[58][59] Foreigners who left China and spent at least 14 days in another country were permitted to enter New Zealand.[60] On 24 February, the Government extended travel restrictions on China by an additional eight days.[61]

On 7 February, the Health Ministry also set up a dedicated Healthline freephone number (0800 358 5453) for COVID-19-related calls.[62] In addition, a Government–chartered Air New Zealand flight evacuated 193 passengers (including 55 New Zealanders and 44 permanent residents) from Wuhan in early February.[63][64] Following the country's first recorded cased on 28 February resulting from overseas travel, the Government extended the country's travel restrictions to include travellers coming from Iran.[65]

March 2020
On 14 March, ahead of the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings which resulted in the deaths of 51 people, a national remembrance service was cancelled out of concerns over the virus. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the decision was a pragmatic one, adding, "We're very saddened to cancel [it], but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn't create the risk of further harm being done." An Auckland festival celebrating Pacific culture was also cancelled.[66] Ardern announced that, effective 01:00 on 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to New Zealand from outside of the country must self-isolate for 14 days. This applies to all travellers, even if they are New Zealand citizens, but excludes travel from the Pacific islands unless the traveller is symptomatic. In addition, restrictions were placed on travel to the Pacific islands from New Zealand, barring travel to the region by those showing signs of coronavirus symptoms, as well as close contacts of coronavirus patients. Cruise ships will be prohibited from docking in New Zealand until 30 June. Ardern described these as being among the "widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world".[67][68][69]

On 16 March, Ardern called for a halt to public gatherings of more than 500 people and warned that the outbreak could lead to a recession greater than the 2008 global financial crisis.[70][71]

On 17 March, Health Minister David Clark announced that the Government would deport foreign tourists who flout self-quarantine restrictions.[72] That same day, Immigration New Zealand placed two foreign tourists into forced quarantine for defying Government requirements to self-quarantine for two weeks. The tourists were ordered to leave New Zealand following their quarantine.[73][74] Finance Minister Grant Robertson announced a $12.1 billion COVID-19 business package that included $8.7 billion for businesses and jobs, $2.8 billion for income support, $500 million for health, and $600 million for the aviation sector and to support supply chains (this did not include any support for Air New Zealand).[75][76][77]

On 18 March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) urged all New Zealanders travelling overseas to return home.[78] In addition, Ardern announced that the New Zealand and Australian Governments would be cancelling Anzac Day services scheduled to be held at Gallipoli in Turkey in response to travel restrictions and the coronavirus outbreak.[79][80]

On 19 March, the Government required the cancellation of indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. This did not apply to workplaces, schools, supermarkets or public transport.[81][82] Ardern announced the closure of New Zealand's borders to all but New Zealand citizens and residents, with effect after 11:59 pm that night. Unlike the previous travel restrictions, this ban also includes Pacific Islanders. Returning New Zealanders are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. The partners, legal guardians or any dependent children travelling with returning New Zealand can return but will need to self-isolate as well.[83][84] However, Samoan and Tongan citizens travelling to New Zealand for essential reasons, "essential health workers", and those seeking to enter the country for humanitarian reasons are exempt from the travel ban.[85]

On 21 March, Ardern introduced a country-wide alert level system to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, similar to the existing fire warning systems. There are four levels, with 1 being the least risk of infection and 4 the highest. The Alert Level was set to 2 and people over 70 years old and those with compromised immune systems were asked to stay at home.[86]


An Emergency Mobile Alert sent at 18:30 on 25 March 2020, informing of the imminent move to Alert Level 4.
On 22 March, Associate Health and Whānau Ora Minister Peeni Henare announced that the Government would invest $56.4 million in funding to aid Māori communities and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes investing $30 million to directly support Māori health workers, $15 million to supporting to Whānau Ora commissioning agencies, and $10 million to support the community outreach.[87]

On 23 March, Ardern raised the Alert Level to 3 and announced the closure of all schools, beginning that day. She also announced that the Alert Level would rise to 4 at 11:59pm on 25 March, instituting a nationwide lockdown. All sports matches and events as well as non-essential services such as pools, bars, cafes, restaurants, playgrounds were required to close in 48 hours, while essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations, and health services would remain open.[88][89][90]

On 24 March, the Government announced that Parliament would adjourn for five weeks beginning on 27 March.[91][92] Prior to its closure, Parliament passed three bills with cross-party support including:

the "Imprest Supply (Third for 2019/20) Bill", which invests $52 billion into emergency spending;[93][94]
the "COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Bill", which allows the Inland Revenue Department to remit interest on tax owing after 14 February;[95] and
"COVID-19 Response (Urgent Management Measures) Legislation Bill", which allows local authorities to meet remotely, the Government to take over schools, and prevents no-cause evictions and freezes rents for six months.[95]
That same day, the Finance Minister announced that the Government was negotiating with banks to ensure that nobody would lose their homes as a result of defaulting on mortgage payments during the pandemic.[96] The Ministry of Social Development's Work and Income NZ division, which deals with welfare payments, switched from face-to-face services to online and phone services, and implemented shift work at its contact and processing centres to facilitate physical distancing.[97]

On 25 March, the Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard announced that Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges would chair a cross-party committee called the Epidemic Response Committee to scrutinise the Government's response to COVID-19.[91] Two-thirds of members will be from the opposition National and ACT parties while the remaining third will come from the governing Labour, New Zealand First, and Green parties. Known members include New Zealand First deputy leader Fletcher Tabuteau, Greens Co-Leader Marama Davidson, and ACT Party leader David Seymour.[95][91][92] That same day, Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare declared a national state of emergency for seven days, that was to coincide with the country's entry into lockdown at 11:59 pm.[98]

On 26 March, Prime Minister Ardern announced that the Government would give $27 million to social service providers such as the Salvation Army and Women's Refuge to help the vulnerable cope with the lockdown.[99] Finance Minister Robertson also announced that the Government had paid $1.5 billion to more than 240,000 workers as part of its Wage Subsidy scheme in response to the pandemic.[100]

On 29 March the New Zealand Police launched a new online form on their website for people to report COVID-19 Alert Level 4 restriction breaches including isolation breaches and businesses operating illegally.[101][102]

On 31 March the Government extended the state of national emergency by seven days, which is separate from the four-week COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown.[103] On 7 April, Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare extended the state of emergency by another seven days, until 14 April 2020.[104]

April 2020
On 8 April, Prime Minister Ardern and Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government was introducing a $87.7 million distance learning package including two education television channels hosted by Suzy Cato, one English and the other Māori, improved Internet access and devices, and educational materials including online resources for parents, handheld devices, and hard copy packs of material for different year levels.[105]

Discussions continue on the possibility of using mobile phone apps to trace contacts (and thus track potential virus spread) – as (for example) in Singapore.[106] (As of 2015 New Zealand had 111.1 mobile connections per 100 citizens,[107] as opposed to Singapore's 150.1.[108][109] Population density and geography also differ.)

On 8 April, New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade announced providing $4 million worth of funds to help the government tackle the health, economic, and social impacts of the COVID-19. It also stated plans of providing $1 million to the Tongan Ministry of Health to help it continue fighting the virus.[110]

On 14 April, the New Zealand Treasury released figures suggesting that the unemployment rate could be kept under 10% if the Government provided extra financial support to help society during the lockdown. Treasury also projected that the country could experience an unemployment rate of 13.5% if the country remains in lockdown for four weeks. Treasury also projected that the unemployment rate could rise between 17.5% and 26% (roughly 750,000) if the lockdown was extended beyond four weeks. Finance Minister Grant Robertson has vowed that the Government will keep the unemployment rate below 10%.[111][112] That same day, the Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare announced that the Government was extending New Zealand's national state of emergency for another seven days until 21 April.[113]

On 14 April, Prime Minister Ardern announced a $130 million support package for tertiary students including increasing the student loan amount for course-related costs for full-time students to $2,000 temporarily, continuing support payments for students unable to study online for up to eight weeks, and making sure that students whose studies have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic's eligibility for student loans and Fees Free study will not be affected.[114][115]

On 15 April, Prime Minister Ardern announced that all government ministers and public sector chief executives would take a 20 percent pay cut. Opposition Leader Simon Bridges has also confirmed that he will take a 20 percent pay cut.[116][117]

On 16 April, Prime Minister Ardern outlined the rules and guidelines for the Government's Alert Level 3. Key policies have included allowing people to swim and fish while banning boating; reopening early childhood; and schools up to Year 10 on a voluntary basis; easing work restrictions; allowing ten people to attend funerals, weddings, and tangi; and allowing food eateries to provide take away services.[118][119] In response, the New Zealand Principals' Federation has expressed concern that the Level 3 rules for schools would create confusion.[120][121]

On 20 April, Prime Minister Ardern extended New Zealand's Alert Level 4 by another week. Ardern justified the extension on the basis that New Zealand needed to "lock in the gains" made so far in the fight against the coronavirus. The Alert Level 4 will end at 11:59 pm on 27 April with the country entering into Alert Level 3 on 28 April for the duration of two weeks.[122][123] Ardern also announced that schools and early childhood centres can prepare to reopen on 29 April with 28 April being designated as a teachers' only day.[124]

On 23 April, Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would be investing $50 million into media relief package to support the New Zealand media. This package includes $20.5m to eliminate TV and Radio transmission fees for six months; $16.5m to reduce media organisations' contribution fees to New Zealand On Air for the 2020/21 financial year; $11.1 million in specific targeted assistance to companies; $1.3 million to purchase central government news media subscriptions; and $600,000 to completely cut Radio New Zealand's AM transmission fees for six months. Faafoi also confirmed that the proposed Radio New Zealand and TVNZ merger had been delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic's economic fallout.[125][126]

May 2020
On 6 May, ahead of the announcement on 11 May about when the country would move down to Alert Level 2, Ardern gave information on how the country would function at Alert Level 2, with several changes from the original outline in March. The new Level 2 guidelines described "a safer version of normal", with the return of recreational activities and businesses with enforced physical distancing, hygiene and customer registration methods, and no more than 100 people per gathering.[127]

On 7 May, Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson announced that professional sports would able to resume domestically under Alert Level 2 if the necessary public health measures were in place.[128][129]

On 11 May, it was announced that New Zealand would enter Alert Level 2 from 11:59 pm on 13 May, lifting lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing in public and for private gatherings with more than ten people. Schools could reopen on Monday 18 May, while bars (defined as on-licence premises that primarily serve beverages) could reopen on 21 May. The decision of whether to increase the limit of a gathering without physical distancing from ten is set to be made on 25 May.[130][131]

On 13 May, the Government passed the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 which gives police and other "enforcement officers" the power to enter homes and other premises without a warrant in order to enforce the Alert Level 2 lockdown. The Bill was opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties, and the Human Rights Commission.[132][133] In addition, Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare lifted the national state of emergency. Health Minister David Clark announced changes to the Alert Level 2 rating, allowing up to 50 people to attend funerals and tangihanga.[133]

On 20 May, the Health Ministry launched a contact tracing app called NZ COVID Tracer, which is available on App Store and Google Play. The app allows users to scan their QR codes at businesses, public buildings and other organisations to track where they have been for contract tracing purposes.[134] While it was formally launched on 20 May, some people were able to download it on App Store on 19 May.[135] During its initial launch, several users encountered difficulties with logging into the app or using it.[136]

On 25 May, Prime Minister Ardern raised the limits on social gatherings including religious services, weddings, and funerals to 100, which came into effect at 12pm on 29 May 2020. Previously, there had been a ten-person limit on religious services and weddings, and a 50-person limit on funerals and tangihanga. Ardern also announced that Cabinet would consider a decision to move into Alert Level 1 on 8 June, with 22 June set as the tentative date for moving into Alert Level 1.[137][138][139] That same day, Finance Minister Grant Robertson introduced a new 12-week relief payment scheme for New Zealand citizens and residents, which comes into effect on 8 June.

In October and November 2020, the horticultural and viticultural industries reported a shortage of workers since the Government's border restrictions and managed isolation requirements prevented tourists and seasonal workers from entering the country. Under the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme, horticultural and viticultural producers are normally allowed to recruit seasonal workers from the Pacific Islands and selected Asian countries. In addition, tourists from certain countries are allowed to work on a visitor visa. This labour shortage has caused fruits and crops to rot. Local growers have reported difficulty in recruiting locals due to the long hours, hard, outdoor work, lower wages, and them lacking the specialised picking and plant-care skills that foreign workers.[298][299][300][301]

In mid–October 2020 Richard Palmer, the CEO of the producer representative body Summerfruit New Zealand, warned that the horticulture might not be able to pick up 30% of its harvest that year, a shortfall that could cost NZ$1.25 billion in export earnings.[302] In late October 2020, Horticulture NZ and the New Zealand Apples and Pears Inc launched a jobs service called Pick Tiki to recruit urban young people into fruit-picking jobs in Hawke's Bay, Nelson, and Central Otago.[301]

Universities and tertiary providers
On 17 March, the University of Canterbury became the first university in New Zealand to recall its exchange students from overseas, stating that "Given the rapidly escalating global situation and the increasing amount of travel restrictions worldwide, and intensive consultation with our partners, [we have] made the very difficult decision to suspend our exchange programmes and recall all UC outbound exchange students, effective immediately."[447]

On 20 March, Massey University stopped face-to-face teaching of courses that could be taught by distance.[448] The University of Auckland suspended classes for the week of 23–27 March to allow staff to prepare for remote teaching in the event of a partial campus closure.[449][448] The University of Otago in Dunedin has also shifted classes with more than 100 students online while students at the University of Canterbury have petitioned for all classes to be moved online.[450]

On 21 March, Auckland University of Technology announced that it would be suspending teaching in response to a petition from students.[451] The University of Canterbury also announced they could move to online learning.[452] On 23 March, all universities suspended physical lectures and shifted to online learning in response to the Government's imposition of an Alert level 3 lockdown.[442]

On 14 April, the Government released a tertiary support package but it was considered unsatisfactory by tertiary students and student associations.[453][454] Several university halls of residence including Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Otago were criticised for continuing to charge rent from students, who had left their accommodation during the lockdown to isolate with their families.[455][456] Other universities like the University of Waikato waived rent for unused accommodation.[457] Green Party MP Chlöe Swarbrick criticised these universities' practices and successfully lobbied for a parliamentary inquiry into student accommodation.[458]

In September 2020, the University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Dawn Freshwater announced plans to resume on-campus teaching on 21 September.

Animal welfare
On 15 April, Stuff reported that many pets included cats and dogs were stuck in transit at pet shipping companies and animal homes due to the disruption of travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown in New Zealand. Due to lockdown restrictions, the transportation of pets is not deemed an essential service. Air New Zealand has announced that it would consider reopening its pet transportation service when Level 4 lockdown restrictions were lifted.[463]

Court rulings
On 4 May, a High Court judge allowed a man who had travelled from the United Kingdom to visit his dying father, overruling the Government's strict lockdown orders including a 14-day quarantine period for all overseas travellers. In response, Prime Minister Ardern asked Health Minister David Clark to review 24 cases where health authorities blocked requests by individuals to see their dying relatives on health grounds.[464][465] As a result of the Government's review, a woman was granted exemption from the mandatory 14-day quarantine to visit her 59 year old terminally ill mother.[466]

On 19 August, the Wellington High Court ruled that the Government's message to stay at home at the start of the Alert Level 4 lockdown for nine days between 26 March and 3 April was justified but unlawful and contrary to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A law change on 3 April made the lockdown legal. The High Court's ruling had come in response to a legal challenge mounted by lawyer Andrew Borrowdale. The Attorney General David Parker has defended the Government's handling of the lockdown and not ruled out an appeal against the ruling.[467][468]

Vaccines
In late August 2020 Stuff reported that several businessmen and former politicians (including former National MP Ross Meurant and former National Party and ACT party leader Don Brash) had sought to import Russia's insufficiently tested Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V) vaccine into New Zealand. They had established a company called Covax-NZR Limited and filed paperwork through the Russian Embassy to establish supply and distribution arrangements to import the vaccine. University of Auckland vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris warned that using untested vaccines could hurt global efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19.[469]

On 12 October 2020, the Government signed an agreement with Pfizer and BioNTech to buy 1.5 million COVID-19 vaccines, which is enough for 750,000 people. The COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Task Force is also negotiating with other pharmaceutical companies to provide vaccines. In addition, the Government has established a fund of $66.3 million to support a COVID-19 immunisation programme as soon as the vaccine is ready.[470]

On 17 December, Prime Minister Ardern announced that the New Zealand Government had purchased two more vaccines for New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and its Pacific partners Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu from the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Novavax. The Government had purchased 7.6 million doses (enough for 3.8 million people) from AstraZeneca and 10.72 million doses (enough for 5.36 million people) from Novavax. Both vaccines require two doses to be administered. Both vaccines will be free for New Zealanders. The Government had already purchased 750,000 courses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 5 million from Janssen Pharmaceutica.[471]

Public opinion
Government response approval
An Utting Research poll conducted on 1–2 March found that 47% of respondents were satisfied with the government's overall response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with 34% unsatisfied and 19% unsure.[472] A subsequent poll conducted on 21–22 March, prior to the lockdown announcement, found that 62% of respondents were satisfied with the response.[473] However, 37% were not confident a large-scale outbreak could be prevented in New Zealand, with 26% confident and 36% unsure.[473]

A Newshub-Reid Research poll conducted from 8 to 16 May 2020 asked whether it was "the right call" to implement the March–April nationwide Level 4 stay-at-home order. 91.6% responded "yes", 6% "no" and 2.5% "don't know".[474]

On 9 August, a Horizon Research poll found that trust in the Ministry of Health and Government's ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic was 82%, down from 91% in April 2020. The poll also found that 64% of New Zealanders still "totally" trusted the Government and Ministry of Health, down from 75% in April.[475]

Media perception
Due to the large viewing of the daily 1 pm press briefings, the actions of and lines of questioning from journalists came under scrutiny from the public, with many criticising repetitive or aggressive lines of questioning and "gotcha" accusations. Stuff journalist Thomas Coughlan replied that the criticism "seemed to come from nowhere" and these actions are "really the way it's always been", saying that the methodology has only come into question due to the large viewership of the press conferences.[476] Television producer Robyn Patterson, writing for Newsroom, commented that the "aggressive stance of some local journalists ... is leading to a public backlash", which "elevates the anxiety levels of an already distressed public and creates deep unease". She noted that a 2019 Griffith University study of journalistic best practice recommended that journalists consider the needs of those impacted by disastrous events or else they risk to cause more harm than good.[477]

International responses
On 8 September, the Secretary-General of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Adhanom praised New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside several other countries including Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, Rwanda, Senegal, Spain, and Vietnam.[478]

On 28 October, Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson criticised Prime Minister Ardern's requirement that people undergoing managed isolation quarantine be tested as a condition for leaving on Fox News's The Ingraham Angle while the show's host Laura Ingraham likened MIQ facilities to coronavirus "quarantine camps".[479] Hanson and Laura Ingraham drew coverage from New Zealand media commentators including The Spinoff's Alex Braee, who compared their remarks to former United Kingdom Independence Party politician Suzanne Evans' remarks likening New Zealand's lockdown policies to Nazi Germany.[480] Newshub's Jamie Ensor responded that Ingraham's comments lacked context, explaining that the camps were actually lavish hotels and motels.[481]

Long-term effects
In April 2020, the New Zealand Treasury projected that the country could experience an unemployment rate of 13.5% if the country remained in lockdown for four weeks, with a range of between 17.5% and 26% if the lockdown was extended.[482] Prior to the lockdown, the unemployment rate was at 4.2%.[483] Finance Minister Grant Robertson vowed that the Government would keep the unemployment rate below 10%.[484]

In the second quarter of 2020, unemployment fell 0.2 percentage points to 4 percent; however, the under-utilization rate (a measure of spare capacity in the labor market) rose to a record 12 percent, up 1.6 percentage points from the previous quarter, and working hours fell by 10 percent.[485]

National GDP contracted 1.6% in the first quarter of 2020.[486] The country officially entered a recession in September after Statistics New Zealand reported a GDP contraction of 12.2% in the second quarter of 2020.[487] The second-quarter contraction was lead by a 47.4% contraction in accommodation and food and beverage services, a 38.7% contraction in transport, postal and warehousing, and a 25.8% contraction in construction.[488]

On 4 November 2020, Statistics New Zealand reported that the unemployment rate had risen to 5.3% as a result of COVID-19, with the number of unemployed increasing by 37,000 to reach 151,000.[489]

Alert level system
On 21 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the introduction of a country-wide alert level system, similar to the existing fire warning systems. There are four levels, with 1 being the least risk of infection and 4 the highest. At the time of the announcement, New Zealand was at Level 2. Each level brings added restrictions on activities or movements. Each region can have an individual alert level based on the severity of their own infections, and these levels can be changed at any time.[490][86]

At the time of Ardern's announcement, New Zealand was at Alert Level 2.[491] Ardern announced on 23 March that, effective immediately, New Zealand would be at Alert Level 3, moving to Level 4 at 11:59 pm on 25 March.[492] On 20 April, Ardern announced that New Zealand would move to Alert Level 3 at 11:59 pm on 27 April, with businesses and schools being allowed to have employees enter the premises during the last week of Alert Level 4 to prepare the facility for the transition to Alert Level 3.[493] The country remained at Alert Level 3 for at least two weeks, with the decision of whether to move down to Level 2 made on 11 May.[494] On 11 May, it was announced that New Zealand would enter Alert Level 2 from 11:59 pm on 13 May, lifting lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing in public and for private gatherings with more than ten people.[130] On 8 June, Ardern announced that the country would enter Alert Level 1 at 11:59 pm that night, lifting the remaining restrictions.[495] After new cases of community transmission were detected on 11 August, New Zealand was moved to Alert Level 2 and Auckland to Level 3 at noon on 12 August;[2] Auckland moved down to Level "2.5", a modified version of Level 2 with further limitations on public gatherings and mandated mask wearing on public transport, at 11:59 pm on 30 August.[7] New Zealand moved to Level 1 on 21 September at 11:59 pm while Auckland moved to Level 2 on 23 September at 11:59 pm.[8] Auckland moved down to Level 1 on 7 October at 11:59 pm.[10]

Lockdown violations
After New Zealand entered into a Level 4 alert lockdown on 25 March 2020, there were several reports of people violating lockdown rules by congregating in crowds. On 1 April, Ardern described 20–29 year olds as the most vulnerable demographic to COVID-19 and called on them to comply with lockdown requirements.[502][503]

On 2 April, there were reports of beachgoers congregating in Auckland's Herne Bay, and Dunedin. Police have visited beachgoers, warning them to comply with the lockdown, while health authorities have warned about the risk of spreading the coronavirus and prolonging the lockdown.[504] In Otago, there have been reports of people jumping off the Albert Town Bridge near Wanaka.[clarification needed][505] In Auckland, Tongan ethnic community leaders have also warned that kava clubs are still meeting despite the lockdown, with some participants posting photos and videos on social media.[506] In Kaitaia, there have been reports of locals taking matters into their own hands by establishing checkpoints to enforce the lockdown.[507]

In early April, Health Minister David Clark was criticised for flouting official guidelines against non-essential travel after he drove to a Dunedin park two kilometres away from his home to ride a mountain bike trail. Clark later apologised to Prime Minister Ardern for not setting a good example to the public.[508][509][510] Later, Clark admitted that he had driven his family twenty kilometres to a nearby beach in Dunedin for a walk during the first week in lockdown. Clark offered his resignation to Prime Minister Ardern, who turned it down due to his role in leading the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, she stripped Clark of his ministerial portfolio as Associate Finance Minister and demoted him to the bottom of Labour's Cabinet list.[511]

In early April, a Christchurch man was arrested by police after posting a Facebook video of himself deliberately coughing and sneezing on customers at a FreshChoice supermarket. Ardern warned that people would be arrested for deliberately coughing on others.[512][513] The man pleaded guilty to a charge of offensive behaviour in the Christchurch District Court. He received a negative test for COVID-19. The man later apologised for his actions.[514][515]

On 7 April, it was reported that the New Zealand Police had recorded 291 breaches under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 and the Health Act 1956. Of these, 263 people had been issued with warnings for breaking lockdown rules, 12 had received a youth referral, and 16 were facing charges. Clark, who was disciplined by the prime minister for violating lockdown requirements, was not listed among the 291 breaches reported.[516][517] On 8 April, the Police Commissioner Andrew Coster updated the figures to 367 breaches including 45 prosecutions, 309 warnings, and 13 youth referrals. Coster also reported that Police were dealing with 37,000 breaches, mainly by businesses.[518]

On 21 April, a Queenstown man was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of one month imprisonment and two weeks' imprisonment for breaching lockdown restrictions and damaging a stainless steel toilet.[519] In Auckland, a 32-year-old woman who allegedly spat at Auckland Transport staff on a train was charged with assault under the Crimes Act 1961. Auckland Transport has reported of incidents of stopping people trying to travel from outlying suburbs like Henderson and Takanini to shop in the city centre and groups of young people travelling on trains for non-essential reasons.[520]

On 3 May, it was reported that Police had received 1,200 reports of people breaching Alert Level 3 restrictions. 686 of these reports were filed between 6 pm on 1 May and 6pm on 2 May. Police confirmed that they had taken enforcement action against 514 people for breaches of either the Health Act or the Civil Defence Emergency Act since Alert Level 3 came into force on midnight 28 April, prosecuting 135 and warning 342.[521] Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Scott Fraser also announced that they had to close down hundreds of parties in the past few days since the Alert Level 3 lockdown came into force. He warned that illegal public gatherings would "waste all the sacrifices" others had to make to beat COVID-19.[522]

On 18 May, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster confirmed that the Police had received 250 reports of illegal mass gatherings in the four days since Alert Level 2 came into effect on 14 May. These included 30 reports of people holding or attending illegal parties; 29 of which resulted in a warning and one in a prosecution.[523]

Managed isolation violations
On 5 July, it was reported that a woman who had escaped managed isolation at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland had been apprehended and charged with breaching the 14-day isolation period under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. The woman had arrived from Australia on 27 June.[524][525]

On 8 July, a 32-year-old man, who had arrived from India, was charged with violating Section 26 (1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 after he escaped managed isolation at the Stamford Plaza Hotel in central Auckland. He visited the Countdown supermarket in Victoria Street before being located by security guards after 70 minutes. After the man tested positive for COVID-19, the supermarket closed temporarily with its staff entering into self-isolation.[526]

On 10 July, a man was arrested for violating the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 after he cut through a fence at a managed isolation facility at Distinction Hotel in Hamilton and visited a liquor store the previous night.[527] The man had tested negative for COVID-19 and was later identified as a 52-year-old Queenstown resident,[528] who had returned from Sydney on 1 July.[527] On 27 August, the Hamilton District Court sentenced him to 40 hours' community service and ordered him to pay NZ$1,000 in reparations for damaging a flat screen television set in his room.[529]

On 11 July, a man in his 60s escaped a managed isolation facility at Waipuna Hotel in Auckland and knocked on the doors of three residents outside the facility. He was subsequently picked up by police and placed under armed guard at Waipuna Hotel.[530][531]

On 25 July, it was reported that authorities had detained a family of five (comprising a mother and four children aged 12, 16, 17, and 18) for breaching managed isolation at the Distinction Hotel in Hamilton. The family had arrived from Brisbane in Australia on 21 July in order to attend a relative's funeral in Auckland. While the family's application for an exemption was being processed by the Health Ministry, they had escaped by breaking a window and scaling a fence. Four members of the family were apprehended by Police in a nearby park while the 17-year old had traveled to Auckland where he was detained by Police there. Government minister Woods has criticised the family breaking the rules, stating that "while we can understand their grief we can not let one tragedy to turn into a tragedy of hundreds." Four members of the family have been charged with breaching a Health Act notice.[532] On 28 August, the mother and her 18-year-old daughter were sentenced to 14 days imprisonment by Judge Noel Sainsbury of the Auckland District Court.[533] The mother and her daughter's harsher sentence in comparison to a 52-year-old man in Hamilton who was sentenced to no jail time raised questions about alleged "systematic racism" in the New Zealand justice system against Māori.[534] New Zealand Public Party leader Billy Te Kahika has advocated on behalf of the woman and her family, also claiming credit for getting her sentence reduced by seven days.[435]

On 30 July, a 32-year-old man, who had travelled from Brisbane, was apprehended following a failed attempt to breach managed isolation at the Crowne Plaza in central Auckland. The man was charged under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act.[535]

On 14 October, a 22-year-old woman was charged with allegedly trying to escape from Auckland's Grand Millennium Hotel during three incidents in October 2020.[536]

on 11 November, the West Indies cricket team were denied further training privileges after members breached managed isolation rules by mingling and sharing food while undergoing managed isolation at the "Chateau in the Park" hotel in Christchurch.[537]

Leaks and misinformation
In early July 2020, National Party MP Hamish Walker admitted leaking the private details of COVID-19 patients to the media.[538] Former National Party President Michelle Boag had passed Walker the information in her capacity as chief executive of the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust.[539] Walker was stripped of his portfolios and later announced that he would not be contesting the 2020 general election.[540] Boag, who also admitted leaking similar information to National MP Michael Woodhouse, subsequently resigned from her position with the Helicopter Trust and her membership of the National Party.[541]

On 18 August 2020, managed isolation and quarantine deputy chief executive Megan Main confirmed that a First Security guard had leaked information about the names, room numbers, and travel itineraries of returnees staying in managed isolation at Auckland's Sheraton Four Points managed isolation facility on Snapchat. Main apologised for the returnees' privacy breach. She also confirmed that the guard had been removed from duty at the hotel and that First Security was conducting an employment investigation into the guard.[542] That same day, The New Zealand Herald reported that a man had admitted spreading a rumor on Reddit that a recent outbreak of community transmissions in Auckland in mid-August had been caused by a family member supposedly entering a managed isolation facility. This rumor was dismissed by health authorities.[543]

Maritime travel breaches
In late September, it was reported that three German yachties had defied New Zealand's COVID-19 laws by sailing from Tahiti to Opua, Northland despite having their application for a border exemption denied by Immigration New Zealand. After being tested and quarantined on their vessel for 14 days, the three returned to Germany on 1 October and are subject to a travel ban from New Zealand. While Immigration New Zealand defended their decision, Rear Commodore Guy Chester of the Ocean Cruising Club expressed concerns about the plight of hundreds of yachties stranded in the Pacific, who were unable to dock in New Zealand and Australia due to COVID-19 border restrictions.[544][545][546]

Support bubble

The support bubble concept
Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand launched the support bubble concept.[547] A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. People in a bubble do not have to practice social distancing from others within the same bubble. The entire bubble counts as one household.[548][549][550]

Testing
Requirements
In early March 2020, there were concerns about COVID-19 tests being given only to people with symptoms who had returned from impacted countries or people who had been in contact with a confirmed case.[551] Some people with symptoms but who did not fit these categories were not tested.[552]

The case definition for qualifying for a COVID-19 test is having "any acute respiratory infection with at least one of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, coryza, [or] anosmia with or without fever."[553]

The previous case definition for testing from 14 March to 3 April was meeting at least one of the following criteria:[554]

symptoms (fever or cough or shortness of breath or sore throat) and travel history
symptoms (fever or cough or shortness of breath or sore throat) and close or causal contact with a suspect, probable or confirmed case
healthcare workers with pneumonia
people treated in intensive care units for severe respiratory illnesses
For cases not fitting this case definition doctors are encouraged to use their own judgement whether to test the patient or not.[555]

On 18 August, Newshub reported that a senior quarantine official had revealed that quarantine workers had requested a regular testing "regime" multiple times but their concerns were ignored. While Prime Minister Ardern had initially claimed that some workers were reluctant, Health Minister Chris Hipkins acknowledged that he was aware that the testing of border staff was incomplete during a briefing, stating that "they should not have been declined tests." Opposition Leader Judith Collins criticised the Government's handling of the issue.[556]

Results
As of 15 December 2020, there have been 1,344,192 tests completed in total,[1] with a positivity rate of 0.13%. As of 27 September 2020, the ethnic group with the highest rate of testing is Pacific, with 27.5% of that population being tested, followed by Māori with 15.9%, European/MELAA/Other with 13.9%, and finally Asian with 12.1%,[i] out of 746,478 people in total,[558] or 14.9% of the New Zealand population of 4,996,000.[559]

Starting from 16 April, random voluntary community testing took place in select supermarkets around the country to provide information on whether there still existed community transmission of the virus.[560][561] This testing resulted in no positive results out of 1000 people by 20 April.[562][needs update]

Statistics
Cases
As of 15 December 2020, New Zealand has 2,096 cases (1,740 confirmed and 356 probable cases) of COVID-19.[1] Based on the national population estimate of 4,966,000[559] this gives the country 350.4 confirmed cases per million population (422.1 confirmed and probable cases per million population).

No cases have been reported in the Chatham Islands,[563] Stewart Island,[citation needed] New Zealand's associated states (Cook Islands, Niue) or the dependent territory of Tokelau.[564]

During the lock down, overall weekly deaths declined in New Zealand compared to previous years.[565] The decline is thought to be linked to a reduction in deaths from traffic collisions, air pollution, work injuries, respiratory tract infections, and elective surgery.[565]

Clusters

Oyster Cove, the venue of the Bluff wedding at Stirling Point

Rosewood Rest Home in Christchurch, the cluster with the greatest number of deaths
As of 17 November 2020, the Ministry of Health had identified 18 significant clusters of at least ten confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases.

There is currently one active significant cluster in New Zealand:[566]

International Mariners, Christchurch – 33 (As of 17 November 2020)

The following clusters have been closed. A cluster is considered closed when there have been no new cases for two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days) from the date when all cases complete isolation.[566]

Auckland August cluster,[567] closed 3 November 2020[568] – 179
Mount Roskill Evangelical Fellowship church "mini cluster"[413]

 A probable case is one without a positive laboratory result, but which is treated like a confirmed case based on its exposure history and clinical symptoms.
 Zero new cases were reported on 19 May, but four 'historic' cases were added to the total number. These cases were from people aboard the Greg Mortimer who tested positive in Uruguay and returned to New Zealand in April. All four cases were classed as recovered by 19 May.[16]
 Three new cases and six "historical" cases were reported on 23 September. The historical cases were from February and were retroactively classified as being caused by COVID-19. They were considered already recovered at the time of reporting.[17]
 The total for 26 September includes one imported case and one "historical" case discovered during contact tracing.[18]
 The total for 8 October includes two imported cases and one "historical" imported case.[19]
 One new case was reported on 16 November, while a previous confirmed case was reclassified as "under investigation", so the total number of confirmed cases remains unchanged.[20]
 Two new cases were reported on 24 November, and one previously confirmed case was reclassified as "historical". Therefore the overall number of cases in New Zealand increased by only one.[21]
 Six new cases were reported on 11 December, all in managed isolation, but two previously confirmed cases were reclassified as "under investigation" as suspected historical cases. Therefore the overall number of cases increased by four.[22]
 The testing data is reported with prioritised ethnicity. If a person has multiple ethnicities, they are reported only as a single ethnicity with the following order of precedence: Māori, Pacific, Asian, Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, Other, European. This is in contrast to total response ethnicity, where a person with multiple ethnicities is reported under all ethnic groups they identify with.[557]
 The number of active cases is the number of total confirmed and probable cases minus the number of recoveries and deaths.
