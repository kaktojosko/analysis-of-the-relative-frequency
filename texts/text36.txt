For most of her life, Laurie Gwen Shapiro has visited a restaurant in Manhattan’s Chinatown on Christmas Day, joining thousands of fellow local Jews in what has become a dining ritual on the holiday.

And while there are plenty of Chinese establishments throughout the city that also serve as gathering places for New York’s Jewish community on Dec. 25, the ones in Chinatown hold a special place for Ms. Shapiro and others, she says. That is because of the neighborhood’s rich history and distinctive character, symbolized by its rows of century-old tenement buildings, and the simple fact it has always been the place to go on the winter holiday.

“It’s amazing how crowded it is,” said Ms. Shapiro, a 54-year-old resident of the Lower East Side, recalling Christmases past.

But this year, those crowds will largely be absent since New York state curbed indoor dining in the city earlier this month. Restaurant operators can still offer delivery and takeout, and many say they plan to do so. They can also welcome patrons to dine outdoors, if they have the proper setup, though they worry the weather will be a factor.

Still, restaurants are expecting to lose thousands of dollars in business on what has indeed been one of their peak days in the pre-pandemic era. And the celebration has usually extended beyond Christmas.
