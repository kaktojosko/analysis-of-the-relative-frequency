Field rations
A field ration1 is a very useful2 part of a soldier's inventory. Field rations are made for use on move. They are very small and easy to carry. Any field ration usually has enough3 food to last for 24 hours. Sometimes you can make it last4 for two or three days. Some of the food inside a field ration is dry and needs some water first. Some food is ready to eat from the get-go5.

Field rations are known by many names in different6 countries. For example, in Canada it’s called an IMP (or Individual Meal Pack). In the United States it’s called an MRE (or Meal-Ready-to-Eat). At first these rations were available7 only for soldiers. Many companies nowadays8 make them for civilians9 too. Civilian rations are very valuable10 in crisis situations. Hurricane Katrina made the demand11 obvious12 in 2005.

A typical field ration will consist of13 a main course14, some sort of a breakfast or a dessert (usually some cereal15, cookies or a chocolate bar) and some drinks (usually as a powder16). Some packs can also have a plastic fork or spoon inside. Advanced packs can also have a heating kit inside: usually it is a small metal stove17, matches18 and some dry fuel. There also might be an accessory pack: towels, napkins19, can openers and such. A main course is always some sort of protein20, usually meat or eggs.

Military field rations usually are illegal to resale. But the market is big anyway, and some of the rarer MREs became very valuable collector items. You can find some of them in historical museums. Those older field ration packs can show us some bits21 of life as it was 50 or 100 years ago and more.
