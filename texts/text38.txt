A resort-style Aspen mansion with an indoor lap pool, a spa, a bowling alley, three outdoor tennis courts and a six-car garage with a turntable is coming on the market for $75 million. If it sold for close to that asking price, the home would be the most expensive ever sold in Aspen.

The ski-in property, located on Ute Avenue within walking distance of Aspen’s downtown, is the brainchild of Aspen developer Leathem Stearn. The project and Mr. Stearn ran afoul of local elected officials, who threatened penalties last year after they alleged he had overbuilt the site. Mr. Stearn maintained he had secured the necessary permits for all construction and the city had signed off on all changes to the original plans.

Mr. Stearn said the issue has since been fully resolved. Phillip Supino, the city’s community development director, confirmed that the issues had been resolved.

In some ways, Ms. Stearn said, the complications around the permitting for the project serve to make the house even more valuable in that it couldn't be replicated under current planning regulations. “There’s never been anything entitled like this before and there never will be again,” he said.

Mr. Stearn began building the more than 20,000-square-foot mansion in 2006 with the goal of turning it into a personal residence for his family but stopped work amid the financial crisis. When he finally finished the property this year, he decided to sell it instead after receiving several unsolicited offers on the home, he said.
