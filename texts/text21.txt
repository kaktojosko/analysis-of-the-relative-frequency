So you want to learn English?
Do you want to learn a new language? Are you not sure where to start? It can be very difficult at the beginning. These 5 easy tips1 will help you to cover your bases2 in your studies.

1. Practice all of your skills. Learn how to read, write, speak and understand other speakers. Don’t focus on just one or two skills! Otherwise you will find it difficult to keep up3 with a real conversation.

2. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Even a native English speaker can do a little slip up4 here and there5. If you make a mistake, make a mental note6 and move on. Don’t dwell7 on it. Don’t let it keep you down. It’s a natural part of a learning process.

3. Surround yourself with English media. That means books, films and even YouTube videos. Don’t be afraid to rewind8 if you don’t understand something. Use the subtitles too!

4. Find a friend to practice together with. You can write messages in English to each other. Or maybe have a casual9 conversation about something. This will give you both an opportunity to grow.

5. Work on your vocabulary. If you see a new word, write it down. Think of a real situation it might be useful for. Ask your teacher about similar10 words and any special things about this particular11 word. There can be plenty12 of those!

The most important thing is to continue no matter what13. Today you learn something new. Tomorrow you learn even more! Soon you will find the difficult things of yesterday to be very easy in practice.
